\section{Overview}

In the last lecture, we\ldots.

In this lecture we\ldots.

\section{Main Section}

We begin by describing the problem\ldots.
Make sure to use sections and subsections.

\subsection{Blah blah blah}
Here is a subsection.

\subsubsection{Blah blah blah}
Here is a subsubsection. You can use these as well.

\subsection{Using Boldface}
Make sure to use lots of boldface.

\paragraph{Question:}
How would you use boldface?

\paragraph{Example:}
This is an example showing how to use boldface to 
help organize your lectures.


\paragraph{Some Formatting.}
Here is some formatting that you can use in your notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Item One\/} | This is the first item.
\item {\em Item Two\/} | This is the second item.
\item \dots and here are other items.
\end{itemize}

If you need to number things, you can use this style:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Item One\/} | Again, this is the first item.
\item {\em Item Two\/} | Again, this is the second item.
\item \dots and here are other items.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Bibliography.}
Please give real bibliographical citations for the papers that we
mentioned in class. See below for how to include a bibliography section.
If you use BibTeX, integrate the .bbl file into your .tex
source. You should reference papers like this: ``The FKS
dictionary originates in a paper by Fredman, Koml\'{o}s and
Szemer\'{e}di \cite{fks}.'' In general, the name of the authors should
appear in the text at most once (for the first citation); further
citations look like: ``Our proof follows that of \cite{fks}''.

Take a look at previous lectures (TeX files are available) to see the details. An excellent source for bibliographical citations is DBLP.\@ Just Google DBLP and an author's name.
