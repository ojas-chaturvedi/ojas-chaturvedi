## :man_technologist: About Me

I'm Ojas Chaturvedi, a passionate high school student from BASIS Chandler, Arizona, deeply intrigued by the world of computing and artificial intelligence.

- 🏫 I'm currently attending BASIS Chandler, where I'm honing my skills in mathematics, science, and technology.
- 💻 I'm applying to colleges with a strong focus on computer science programs, as I aim to build a solid foundation in this field.
- 🌟 My goal is to earn a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and follow it with a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence.
- 🔍 I'm particularly interested in machine learning, neural networks, and the ethical implications of AI.
- 📈 While my GitHub contribution calendar might not show daily activity, I utilize GitHub as a repository for my significant projects and learning milestones. My focus is on the quality of contributions and the depth of learning they represent rather than the quantity of daily commits.

## What I'm Learning

- 📘 Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in advanced algorithms and data structures.
- 🤖 I'm also taking online courses related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Looking Ahead

- 🎓 I'm in the process of college applications and am excited about the opportunities to further my education in computer science.
- 💡 I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with others who share my interests.
- 🔮 For a glimpse into what I'm currently working on, check out my [In-Progress Projects](#in-progress-projects) section below.

## In-Progress Projects

I believe in continuous learning and development. Here's what I am currently working on:

- [Shooting Through the Text: Uncovering Sentiments in Congressional Gun Legislation](https://github.com/ojas-chaturvedi/NLP-Gun-Legislation) - This project conducts a detailed sentiment analysis of congressional gun legislation, utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing to dissect and categorize legislative text and intent. By differentiating legislation into pro-gun rights and pro-gun control stances and examining the underlying rhetorical strategies within the bills, it aims to reveal the impact of language and sentiment on legal outcomes, contributing significantly to the understanding of legislative perspectives in the complex debate of gun control.
